                      Yeah so at first it seemed difficult since nothing worked like I imagined, but after all it was just not knowing where to click to get things done.
                      The c# scripts that are used to control things seem to have really similar structure as arduino code has, like as arduino has setup and loop, unity c# has startup and update.
                      There's a lot to learn before I can get anything actually done with the unity though.

                      And I'm still trying to make this "blog" website of my own. Now that I've got it working somewhat as I wanted, I've started to doubt myself that if it's good at all.<br>
                      Do I want to make finnish translations? I'd have to figure out how to toggle them... And how to save the preference? Cookies? I'm not sure I want to go there.
                      All the websites now have the alert that they are using cookies and they have to be accepted. Would I have to do that too?<br>
                      I'm still also trying to decide what to do when there are too many post to show on one page. How many is too many, 10? I don't know.
