                        Ok, so I guess I have to figure out how to make the image in these posts to be constant width, 
                        resizing and cropping them manually is too much hassle,
                        and having all the images with different widths looks really bad.
                        <br>
                        Hmm, maybe I'll change the structure of these "posts" for the next one, 
                        divide it into two "rows" and then divide the upper one into 2 parts, one for title and other for some picture, 
                        and have the lower one for the content? I wonder if that would work. 
                        <br>
                        Also at the front page of the portfolio, I have to figure out what to do to the entries, 
                        each have photos with different aspect ratios and that makes them different height.
                        <br>
                        But anyway I was supposed to write something about the camera rotator part of the portfolio...
                        I really would like to have a 3d view of the whole thing, and possibly for each part? Maybe one that has some animation?
                        I already managed to get some webGL stuff going on with three.js, but it feels weird and doesn't really want to sit in a container,
                        Or at least the example I used. Do I really need to reinvent the wheel again?
                        <br>
                        How about the language selection? if I write both finnish and english versions, 
                        I can probably get it done, but how do I make it stick? Wouldn't it revert back at page reload?
                        Do I need cookies, and is there some legal hassle with them because I see so many pages informing that this site uses cookies and user needs to click that it's ok? 
                        What's up with that?
