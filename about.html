                 <p class="text-muted">So, this is it. I'm finally trying to put something together. It is a daunting task but it needs to be done. I'd want it to be automatically sorting and have options to show certain type of stuff with a click of a mouse. I have no idea how to do it, and I'd hate it if I had to manually do things when adding a new entry.</p>

           <h1 class="display-4 font-italic">So, about me, huh?</h1>
           <p class="lead my-3">
             What should I write... I'm currently unemployed, 39 year old dude living in Hyvinkää, Finland.
             I've tried all sorts of things for a work, like woodworking, building and assembling outdoor furnitures and playground items,
             driving a bus and stuff like that. I didn't really like any of that...</p>
           <p class="lead my-3">
             My real passion has always been in doing things with a computer, but back when I should have made right decisions about education and stuff,
             I didn't consider it as a real job. But I've got a vocational degree in business information technology.
           </p>
           <p class="lead my-3">
             So what do I do then?
             A lot of gaming for starters. But I do some 3d designing too, like models for 3d-printing and fantasy weapons for a friend's card game project.
             I also have some projects of my own, like a camera 'rotator', or an arduino-controlled motorized panoramic head for a camera.
             I designed and printed all the plastic parts.
             The rotator rotates a DSLR camera around it's nodal point and shoots pictures, which can then be stitched into a full photosphere.
             Rotating the camera around the nodal point minimizes the parallax effect and makes the panorama stitching easier.
             So I've also done some Arduino programming, that's basically c++. I also know some Java.
           </p>
           <p class="lead my-3">
             Instead of trying to explain it all here, I'll make this site into a blog and portfolio.
             Some already existing site like tumblr would probably work better as a blog, but I'll do it like this for now...
