                  <p class="card-text mb-auto">Ugh, I lost almost 2 weeks, and I thought that it was only couple of days. I just didn't feel like doing anything about the blog project.
                      Why? Because stuff just didn't work. Yeah so it turns out I need Ajax, but after banging my head to the wall for a while,
                      I just didn't want to think about it any more. But now I'm at it again and figured out that the jquery link that comes with bootstrap didn't support ajax???
                      One from googleapis works. Yeah FUN FUN FUN, the test code worked after all but how could I know what to choose when there is multiple 
                      versions of everything related to javascript? Seriously someone should sort it out.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text mb-auto">
                      Anyway, I have no idea how things like this are supposed to be done, I'm likely trying to invent the wheel again, as how it is with everything, always.
                      So, I have this one page that holds everything else except the content itself, and then the content goes into separate pages which are loaded into this one with jquery.
