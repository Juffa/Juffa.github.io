          <p class="text-center text-muted">A friend of mine asked me to draw some fantasy weapons for his BatMud -themed card game project.
                I used the descriptions from him and from BatMud as a guide, and I drew them in Blender, and rendered with Blender's cycles renderer.<br>

                                        Description: "It is a gleaming green blade, a sabre to be more accurate. Its quality is very fine. 
                                        The hilt, made of the same metal as the blade, 
                                        but bound with leather for better grip, is embedded with some emeralds."

                                    This was the first one of these weapons I made, and it was quite a learning experience.
                                    I made the first version with just experimenting myself, then I started doing the blender tutorials (anvil etc),
                                    and figured out that I'll have to remake the whole sword.<br>
                                    The material is supposed to be bronze, but 'gleaming' green, so I came up with this green-tinted bronze-like material.<br>
                                    The weapon type is a sabre, not a cutlass or anything else, so I think it needs to look like a sabre.<br>
                                    It ended looking like an actual weapon, although green.

                                    I decided to go with a blade profile from a Muramasa sword, since they are legendary "evil" swords.<br>
                                    The blade is made out of diamond in the game, but the whole sword can't be made out of one material, and it didn't look good transparent anyway.<br>
                                    I added some filters with voronoi texture to the blade to give it a flickering red pattern.

                                        Description: "This is the legendary sword of wonders. Some say it is cursed, some say it is blessed, but all that is certain is that it is strange. 
                                        The blade is five feet long and made of green crystal. The hilt is made of red crystal and the pommel is an octagonal dull grey gemstone.

                                    This weapon is a bastard sword, or hand-and-a-half sword, so it can be used one-handed or two-handed if needed, so I went looking for pictures of them.
                                    I found one really nice desing, the Glamdring, Gandalf's sword in Lord of the Rings movies... So I went ahead and copied from that to some extent.<br>
                                    The materials in game are pretty silly, green and red crystal, but it's a magical sword, so I went with them.<br>
                                    As the pommel is supposed to be extra special, I went with some glow-in-dark specials in it, but... 
                                    description says it's dull grey, so it's unnoticeable in the final render.

                                    This was a bit difficult to approach at first since the description is so vague, but then I finally had this idea and added things that are not in the description.<br>
                                    I think it ended up being the best of them all.

                                    So, I was a bit confused at first since the description and the additional description differ quite a bit, but this is what I came up with.<br>
                                    The design is somewhat copied from an low resolution image I was provided with.<br>
                                    Personally I dont think that the shaft is very sturdy since it's made of wood, but... Yeah another magical weapon.

                                    This was the second one of the set I made. The weapon is made of hematite<br>
                                    As hematite in crystal form is very geometric and angular, I went with that kind of a design.<br>
                                    I added a steel shaft and the counterweight even if they weren't in the description.<br>

                                    Again a bit conflicting descriptions but I went with a combination of the two.<br> 
                                    First I researched what kind of a weapon a "voulge" excatly is, and I found out that they were often improvised weapons,
                                    where the blade is not on top of a pole but attached to the side. Sometimes they have a pointy tip but sometimes they don't.<br>
                                    Hardest part in designing this was figuring out how the blade is attached to the shaft.

                                        Description: "This weapon is not just made to kill. It is made to mutilate, dismember, torture and kill. Its substance seems to absorb light hungrily."<br>

                                    Pretty vague descriptions again so I took a freedom to add some things to the shaft. 
                                    I tried some colors but the white was only one that really seemed to work, though it wouldn't stay white for long in use.<br>
                                    BUT it's a magical LAEN (a type of glass) weapon which never breaks or gets dirty.<br>
                                    The weapon type is a trident, but who says that all the prongs have to be in line? So I made the head into this 3-dimensional shape.

                                        Description: "This weapon is a lengthy shaft of enchanted oak, topped with a triangular head of gleaming, translucent ruby. 
                                        The spear is void of any runes, barbs, or decorations commonly found on enchanted weapons. "<br>

                                    This was a difficult one. First I researched about what kind of shapes rubies are cut into, and I chose one and modified a bit.<br>
                                    But how do you attach a ruby into a pole??<br>
                                    In the first version (on the left), I made a metal setting for the ruby which attaches to the pole, but it just didn't look good. And the pole looks like a brush shaft.<br>
                                    Then I had this idea that what if the magical oak shaft grew branches that bound the ruby firmly to the shaft Like fingers?<br>
                                    I had to make the shaft much thicker, but if it too thick it becomes unwieldy... <br><br>
                                    The whole thing ended up looking like a staff.
