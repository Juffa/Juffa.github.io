                                    This was a bit different, since I had to actually draw, and I'm not very good at that...But I can somewhat successfully copy images I see.<br>

                                    The real life couch is not in pristine condition like the 3d version, since it's rather old and been through a lot.<br>
                                    I wanted to model something a bit more challenging...<br>
                                    Also this is the first project where I did some sculpting, it felt really difficult.<br> 
                                    I sculpted the grooves and stuff like that, baked a normal map out of them and now they are applied on top of the clean lowpoly mesh.
                                    
                                </p>

                                           So I wanted to try to make a character, one I would rig so I could move it around into different poses... Gargamel was my first attempt.
                                           <br>
    
                                        </small>
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="card-text text-white">
                                        I did this just by moving and extruding points, just like one would do a retopology on a sculpted surface, but without a surface. <br>
                                        I wasn't confident I could do any scupting, it felt daunting.<br>
                                        The Gargamel ended up looking about right, but the rigging was a problem...<br> 
                                        In the tutorial I had watched, they manually set the weights for vertices, but it just took a lot of time and didn't look that good at all.<br>
                                        Also none of the the things that aren't part of the main mesh weren't following the rig, even if it somehow worked in the tutorial video?<br>
                                        <br>
    
                                        Later I found out a lot easier way to do that and also the proper way to rig clothes and accessories.

                                            Though here Smurfette is a bit more grown-up... In more than one ways.<br> 
                                            I had planned "something" for Gargamel and Smurfette, but as Smurfette started to form up, I couldn't do that to her.<br>
                                            It would be just wrong.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            I had the same problem with Smurfette and rigging as with Gargamel, when I was doing them with the likely outdated tutorial.<br>
                                            Later rigging attempts with different methods worked better.<br>
                                            Smurfette is also made in the same way as the Gargamel, no sculpting.

                                                I decided to model something I have on my desk. So I modeled a Wacom pen.

                                            The whole pen has a roughness map on it, but it's really visible on the button. Looks like fingerprints, just like on the real thing.<br>
                                            Proper textures and various maps really make the difference here.<br>
                                            It turned out VERY realistic, but it is a 3d image I assure you!<br>

                                                Yeah Ok I felt it was necessary to model the tablet too, after the pen.

                                            This tablet was a lot more difficult to make than the pen, it's actually a single mesh (except for the lights and so, they are separate meshes). It's not 100% accurate, but close enough.

                                                It started as a head, I was just scuplting away and suddenly it looked like cartoony rat head, so I went with it...<br>
                                                But as I had to find some rat pictures for a reference, the rest of the body ended up looking like actual rat would look, not so much a cartoon rat<br>
                                                I tried making a fur with the blender's particle system, but no matter what it ended up looking really bad.<br>

                                                    Vizlet is a character from a webcomic <a href="http://www.valsalia.com/">Valsalia.</a>
                                                </small>
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="card-text text-white">
                                                So I had done those '1 hour sculpt' practices for a while, and wanted to spend a little more time into a new character.<br>
                                                This one, or rather the character's basic mesh, is completely sculpted.<br>
                                                It started as just a head:<br>
                                                <img class="card-img-top" src="/portfolio/BlenderProjects/Yinglet.jpg"><br>
                                                I had been watching some blender videos on youtube by YanSculpts, and decided to use same or similar methods he was using... <br>
                                                Or at least try to. He makes amazing things in Blender.<br>
                                                Then I expanded it into a full body mesh:<br>
                                                <img class="card-img-top" src="/portfolio/BlenderProjects/Vizlet2.jpg"><br>
                                                Then I made her some clothes and added some basic materials, they actually look good enough, though she's still missing some pink hue from the face and ears.<br>
                                                At this point I really wanted to make her move, so I looked again into the rigging process and found a lot better advice than the previous tutorials I watched...
                                                That was just to use automatic weights instead of manually setting the weights. It works perfectly if the skeleton is well defined.<br>
                                                Also the rigging clothes problem was somewhat solved, I got them to follow the mesh, but it obviously needs probably shape keys or bones for the clothes, too.<br>
                                                The mesh is probably too highpoly and my computer is way too old and weak for this, since moving the character now is slow like 1 frame per second, or less...<br>
                                                But I still managed to make her sit and grab a mug. :)<br>

                                                Little did Vizlet know that these two had a history. <br>

                                                it's also rigged, and that's the second purpose for this simple model, so I can practise that stuff easily.

                                                    A sword I made based on a sketch by someone on imgur.

                                                It's so much easier to make a 3D image out of someone's sketch than desing one from scratch. Even of the sketch is extremely simple and badly drawn.<br> 
                                                I spent 3 hours making this.

                                                    Quick one hour sculpting practices.

                                                Some of these are made with using random reference images, probably the better looking ones..<br>
                                                The idea here is to sculpt for one hour, no more, no less, and after one hour the sculpt cannot be continued.<br> 
                                                If I want to make one into a full-blown character, I'd have to start from scratch. That's a self-imposed rule that helps with learning things.<br>
